Directory Brute-Forcing Tool
This tool is designed for discovering directories on a web server through brute-forcing. It allows you to specify a target URL and either use a custom wordlist or a predefined local wordlist for directory discovery. The tool utilizes concurrent HTTP requests to improve performance and includes logging functionality to track discovered directories.

Features
URL Targeting: Provide a target URL to search for directories.
Wordlist Options:
Use a custom wordlist file (-w argument).
Use a predefined local wordlist (-LW argument).
Concurrency: Utilizes concurrent.futures to handle multiple HTTP requests simultaneously.
Logging: Logs discovered directories and errors to a specified log file.
